The provided code implements a spell checker with the following functionalities:

1. **Tokenization:** It reads dictionary and input text files, splitting them into individual words and converting them to lowercase.

2. **Dictionary Loading:** It stores words from the dictionary file (`dict.txt`) in an unordered_map (`dictionary`).

3. **Spell Checking:** It iterates through each word in the input text file (`input.txt`).
    * **Dictionary Check:** If the word exists in the dictionary (`dictionary.find(newI) != dictionary.end()`), it's considered correct and pushed onto a stack (`checkedWords`).
    * **Spell Correction:** If the word is not found:
        * It calculates the Levenshtein distance (number of edits) for this word compared to every other word in the dictionary.
        * It creates a temporary map (`top3`) to store the 3 closest words (based on Levenshtein distance) from the dictionary.
        * It prompts the user to choose a correction from these 3 suggestions (including an option to keep the original word).
        * The user's chosen word (or the original word) is pushed onto the `checkedWords` stack.

4. **Output Generation:**
    * It reverses the `checkedWords` stack into a final stack (`FinalStack`).
    * It writes the words from `FinalStack` (corrected or original) to the output file (`output.txt`) in the correct order.

Overall, this code provides a good foundation for a basic spell checker. You can extend it further based on your needs.
